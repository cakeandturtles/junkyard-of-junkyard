a few other potential solutions:

-A MUD where you pick your character and learn new combat abilities to fight endless swarms of enemies.

-Walking through the woods as a little kid exploring and finding stuff and not getting killed by bears or panthers.

-You need to make the pacing right. The Arc (short), the level (miniscene), and the action must all be fun and paced correctly

-Multiplayer text game??? Where two players are presented a goal and one player must describe what he sees and the other player must control the player avatar?
  -Red team and blue team. Whichever side has more orbs or whatever wins



-Magic rhyming. Rhyme fight.
