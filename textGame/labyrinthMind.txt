Welcome to the Labyrinth of the Mind! This is a place where the collective unconscious is constructed into something more. A place where you may delight in the memories of youth or mourn and wallow in memories of death and loss. This is not a real place. At least I don't think it is. But maybe if you immerse your childish fancies and suspend your disbelief well enough, well then maybe it can be real. After all, who am I to dispute the reality you choose to accept? 

Along your travels you may meet various characters. Keep in mind that these are not real people. They are merely psychic incarnations of emotions or memories. There personalities are derived from these memories and even though they may help you on your journeys, ultimately anything you do to them, anything they do for you, or, rather, anything at all that happens in this world, is entirely meaningless.
