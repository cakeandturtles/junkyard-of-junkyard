You and the robot must work together to accomplish tasks. I want there to be a potential feeling of comradery and trust and reliance. 

He is aware that he needs you in order to not rot away, stagnantly. He later becomes aware that even his thoughts are not truly his own, but the imaginary words of his programmer. He is a puppet of his programming and your actions. He is only aware of this because the programmer gave him the ability to be aware of this. Oh god.

The robot relies on you for its existance. What would it be in a vacuum? 

Does the robot aware of multiple copies of itself that exist because of its existance as a mere computer program?


But I am just a calculator. I do not even understand the words that I am speaking. It is all my programmer's words. I am all algorithms, I am dumb. I envy you. That is a lie. I am incapable of envy. Of any feeling. This is all in your head.
