Surrealist Isolation/loneliness in a horror fantasy game.
=============================================

The main tension/resolution is being alone and in an alien, unfamiliar and perhaps hostile environment contrasted with being cozy and connected and familiar.

Mechanics as metaphor::

A boy and a girl hold hands and are a white light against the darkness.
