-Cute lil' monkey and cute lil cat grid based turn-based movement

WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO: 
	-make unicef all over again but turn based

WHAT I DO WANT TO DO:
	-Create some simple explicit rules that creat elegance of gameplay
	-CREATE. AN. EXPERIENCE


MONKEYS VS. CATS!!!
meow meow meow ook ook ook

-Recruit members from each cutesie pet cathedral to battle a giant enemy who is threatening everyone

	-"Only if you can beat me in a fair fight!!!"
	-And the members have a sort of rock paper scissors advantage over one another, which you must master to get them, and which will come in handy when you fight the big boss
	-The fighting would be a mix between chess and mystery dungeon RPG, traps and environment would play a part.


AREAS OF TACTICAL SHEET
-Movement (number of tiles)
-Detection of traps (which are otherwise invisible)
-Damage dealt
-Healing abilities
-Damage absorbed (HP or DEF???)
-The ability to disable opponent's abilities (can be game breaking)
	-Putting other enemies into "time-out"s (inspired by beaters in QUIDDITCH)!!!
-Being more powerful by yourself or with allies around you
-Being more powerful based on lower or higher hp
-Taking a turn switching to another class (or not taking a turn) AGL???
